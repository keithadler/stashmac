# Notarizes build/Stash for Mac.app so it opens on any Mac without warnings.
#
# One-time setup (needs an Apple Developer account, $99/year). Nothing below is required to build or run locally.
#   1. Create a Developer ID Application certificate at developer.apple.com and
#      install it in Keychain Access.
#   2. Create an app-specific password at appleid.apple.com, then store it:
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials "stashmac" --apple-id you@example.com --team-id TEAMID
#   3. Build signed:  SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./build-app.sh
#   4. Run this script.
